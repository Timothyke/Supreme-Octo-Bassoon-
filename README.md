🛡️ Cyber Guardian Dashboard
Welcome to the Cyber Guardian Dashboard! This project is designed to provide an intuitive interface for monitoring and assessing network vulnerabilities using Nmap. 🚀🔍

📜 Overview
The Cyber Guardian Dashboard integrates Nmap, a powerful network scanning tool, to detect open ports and services on networked systems. The dashboard visualizes scan results, helping you stay informed about potential security vulnerabilities in your network.

🚀 Features
Nmap Integration: Perform network scans using Nmap.
Vulnerability Visualization: View scan results in an easy-to-understand format.
Real-Time Monitoring: Monitor network status and vulnerabilities in real time.
Customizable Scans: Configure scan parameters and targets as needed.
⚙️ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x: Download Python
Flask: Install Flask via pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install Flask
Nmap: Ensure Nmap is installed on your system. Install Nmap on Kali Linux using:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install nmap
🛠️ Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cyber-guardian-dashboard.git
cd cyber-guardian-dashboard
Install Dependencies: Install required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Your Environment: Ensure Nmap is correctly installed and accessible from your PATH.

🏃 Running the Application
Start the Flask Server: If port 5000 is in use, you can specify a different port. Here’s how to run it on port 5001:

bash
Copy code
python3 app.py
If you encounter an "Address already in use" error, you might need to stop other processes using port 5000, or you can modify the app.py to use a different port (e.g., app.run(debug=True, port=5001)).

Access the Dashboard: Open your browser and navigate to:

Arduino
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000
🧩 Project Structure
app.py: Main application file that initializes and runs the Flask server.
keylogger.html: HTML template for displaying scan results.
keylogger.js: JavaScript for handling dynamic content and user interactions.
keylogger.py2: Python script for handling backend processes and interactions.
requirements.txt: Lists Python dependencies.
🔍 Example Usage
Run a Scan: Trigger a scan using the web interface.
View Results: Check the results displayed on the dashboard.
Analyze Data: Use the data to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
